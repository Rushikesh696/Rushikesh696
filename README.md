## 🚀 About Me

I’m a curious and self-driven learner with a strong foundation in statistics, machine learning, and deep learning. I enjoy building end-to-end data solutions, from cleaning messy datasets to deploying machine learning models in production. Currently, I'm diving deeper into **Generative AI** and advanced NLP techniques.

Passionate about solving real-world problems through data, I constantly explore new tools and technologies to sharpen my skills. I’ve worked on projects involving computer vision, time series analysis, and LLM-powered applications, and I enjoy contributing to open-source initiatives and sharing my learnings through blogs. My goal is to build intelligent, scalable, and impactful AI solutions that bridge the gap between research and real-world implementation.
